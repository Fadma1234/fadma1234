Hi, Iâ€™m Fadma.

Iâ€™m a software engineer & full-stack web developer who started out in the world of healthcare. My journey began with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physical Therapy, years of work as a Certified Nursing Assistant, and time as a medical interpreter helping patients in four languages.

Those experiences taught me patience, empathy, and the importance of clear communication â€” qualities I now bring into building software. Today, instead of helping people in a hospital, I help them through web applications that are simple, functional, and accessible.

ðŸŒŸ A little about me

 I enjoy turning ideas into working web apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

 I speak four languages, which makes me curious about different cultures and inclusive design.

 Iâ€™m passionate about combining healthcare and technology to build tools that can make peopleâ€™s lives easier.

 Currently building my portfolio and always excited to learn something new.
